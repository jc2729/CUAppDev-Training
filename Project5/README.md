# Project 5: Tinder App

This app is modeled after Tinder: The user is presented with a stack of cards with people’s faces/names
The user can swipe left if he/she "likes" the person or swipe right is he/she doesn't.'

Implemented Challenge Problems: <br>
[ ] Add an x or check overlay depending on the direction swiped <br>
[x] Add a button to reset cards in shuffled order <br>
[ ] Add a navigation controller for a screen that shows the people the user "likes" <br>
