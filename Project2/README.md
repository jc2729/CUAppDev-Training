# Project 2: Square Arena App

This application allows the user to place an unlimited number of shapes
on the screen. The user starts on a “landing page” where he/she can select which shape arena to enter. Every time the user taps somewhere on the view, a corresponding shape appears there.

Implemented Challenge Problems: <br>
[x] Present the blue squares arena modally <br>
[x] Add a third arena to display squares with random colors <br>
[x] Group arenas by having one ShapeViewController that can display different shapes depending on which button was clicked on the landing page <br>
[ ] Introduce a UISlider that can control the size of the square <br>
[x] Add the ability to show or hide all the shapes on screen <br>
[x] Add an eraser functionality that will remove a shape when tapped <br>
[x] Add a triangle arena
