# Project 1: Student Info App

This is an application storing a list of students. Each student has a name, year, major, and GPA. Every time a student is added to the list, the entire list of students is printed out.

Implemented Challenge Problems: <br>
[x] Validate the year so that it can only be a logical number <br>
[x] Verify that the GPA is valid <br>
[ ] List the students in sorted order <br>
[ ] Set a birthday for the student using a UIDatePicker <br>
