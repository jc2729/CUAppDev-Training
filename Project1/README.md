# Project 1: Student Info App

This is an application storing a list of students. Each student has a name, year, major, and GPA. Every time a student is added to the list, the entire list of students is printed out.

Implemented Challenge Problems:
[x] Validate the year so that it can only be a logical number
[ ] Verify that the GPA is valid
[ ] List the students in sorted order
[ ] Set a birthday for the student using a UIDatePicker
